= Malware Investigation Template

Because `.idb` files should be version controlled.

== Warning

Large binary files like `pcap` files don't belong in git. The repository will
slow down once it reaches a few gigabytes. To avoid pushing `pcap` files by
mistake the `pcaps/` directory is ignored in `.gitignore`.

== Starting an investigation

1. Fork this repository using github or via command-line (specify
   investigation name):
+
    git clone https://github.com/GoSecure/malware_investigation_template.git Win32.Bad.A
+
2. Configure where the `pcaps` will be rsync'ed
+
    echo 'PCAP_DST=<rsync path spec>' > .config.sh

Voil√†!

NOTE: Forks of public repositories can't be made private on github. It is
advised to use the command-line and push to a private repo if you plan on
hosting your analysis on github.

== Usage

=== Pcaps

A helper script has been provided to sync `pcap` files. Simply use `push`
command to send files and `pull` to receive the files.

For example:

    $ src/helpers/pcaps.sh push

=== Integration with malboxes

// TODO

Coming soon...

== License

I don't think this is copyright'able because it is just a bunch of directory
names, some documentation and a small script but just in case, here we go:
